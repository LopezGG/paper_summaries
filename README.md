# Paper Summaries

A personal collection of research paper summaries organized by topic. This repository helps me keep track of papers I've read, their key contributions, and my notes.

## 📝 How to Add a New Paper Summary

1. **Copy the template:** Use `TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point
2. **Choose the right category:** Place your summary in the appropriate subdirectory under `summaries/`
3. **Name the file:** Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `attention_is_all_you_need.md`)
4. **Fill in the details:** Complete all sections in the template:
   - Basic information (authors, year, venue, link, tags)
   - Summary (brief overview)
   - Key contributions
   - Methodology
   - Results
   - Strengths and limitations
   - Personal notes
   - Related papers
